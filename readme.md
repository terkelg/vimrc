## Vimrc

> My sweet sweet vim configuration

- Foldable and thoroughly commented `vimrc`.
- Put your customizations into `vimrc_local`.
- Move freely between Vim and tmux using `‚å•-h/j/k/l`
  (plugin-free, requires [some configuration](https://github.com/lifepillar/dotfiles/blob/master/dot-tmux.conf) in tmux, too).
- 40-column **cheat sheet** always two keys away (courtesy of [Cheat40](https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-cheat40)).

### Requirements

- A fairly recent Vim (7.4 or later) (`brew install vim` recommended on macOS).

Recommended:

- Vim 8.
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) (only the executable);
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep).

### Installation

```sh
    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/terkelg/vimrc.git .vim
    cd .vim
    # install Pug
    ./install.sh
```
