## Vimrc

> My sweet sweet vim configuration

- Foldable and thoroughly commented `vimrc`.
- Loads okay fast.
- Put your customizations into `vimrc_local`.
- Uses the built-in vim plugin manager.
- Move freely between Vim and tmux using `‚å•-h/j/k/l`
  (plugin-free, requires [some configuration](https://github.com/lifepillar/dotfiles/blob/master/dot-tmux.conf) in tmux, too).
- 40-column **cheat sheet** always two keys away (courtesy of [Cheat40](https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-cheat40)).

### Requirements
